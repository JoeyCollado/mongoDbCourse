# mongoDbCourse

# MongoDB = is a no sql database management system that can manage huge data, use a nosql format unlike sql which is relational

# N = not 
# O = only
# S = structured
# Q = query
# L = language
# = data stores in various formats
# = instead of table we stored data as a single document
# = each document is kind of like a single row in a table in sql
# = data is stored as field value pairs, similar to json format, but technically it's bsawn binary javascript object notation
# = both behaves similarly

// = general idea is = data which is frequently accessed together is stored together rather than in separate tables

//document = is a field of group value pairs to represent an object
//collection = is a group of one or more documents 
//database = is a group of one or more collections
